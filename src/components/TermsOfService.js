                    {"TERMS OF SERVICE & PRIVACY POLICY\n\n=TERMS OF SERVICE=\n\nThis application is operated by Iris Inami. Throughout the application, the terms \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refer to Iris Inami. Iris Inami offers this application, including all information, tools and services available from this application to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here.\n\nBy creating an account, you engage in our \"Service\" and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (\"Terms of Service\", \"Terms\"), including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the application.\n\nWithout advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement or for any other reason we choose: (1) suspend your access to Citru.me, (2) suspend or terminate your account, and/or (3) remove any of your user content from Citru.me.\n\nWe reserve the right to monitor Citru.me, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all.\n\nYou may not use Citru.me to break the law, violate an individual's privacy, or infringe any person or entity's intellectual property or any other proprietary rights.\n\nWe are not responsible for any decisions you make based on something you see on Citru.me. Certain content available via our Service may include materials from third-parties.\n\nThird-party links on this site may direct you to third-party websites that are not affiliated with us. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and we do not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third-parties.\n\nAll the things you do and all the information you submit or post to Citru.me remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.\n\nSpecifically, you agree to hold Citru.me, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of Citru.me, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.\n\nCitru.me is provided \"as is\" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or electronic. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content. We do not guarantee that Citru.me will always work properly.\n\nWe will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use Citru.me, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.\n\nYou agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to your use of Citru.me.\n\n=PRIVACY POLICY=\n\nWe want you to understand how and why Iris Inami (\"we\" or \"us\") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you access and use Citru.me (the \"Service\") or when you otherwise interact with us.\n\nWe collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services.

This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, user interactions (e.g., voting data), the requested URL, hardware settings, and search terms.\n\nWe use information about you to: provide, maintain, and improve the Services; help protect the safety of Citru.me and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Citru.me Terms of Service; send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices and other support and administrative messages; provide customer service; monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services; and personalize the Services and provide advertisements, content and features that match user profiles or interests.\n\nWhen you submit a post or comment to the Services, visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see the content of your posts and comments, the username associated with your posts or comments, and the date and time you originally submitted the post or comment.
